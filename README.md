## Usage

This line will convert the file to json.

```bash
$ npx dynamodb-csv-convert file.csv > file.json
```

## Please don't use this tool to do backups…

And here is why. This tool is just for simple stuff – it's designed to be a
small CLI utility to quickly convert those pesky (S), (SS), etc to a valid JSON
document. However, this utility does not support the whole typeset that can be
exported; thus, you'll have issues if you needed to convert this for any real
things.

This tool does not support; BS, NS, SS
